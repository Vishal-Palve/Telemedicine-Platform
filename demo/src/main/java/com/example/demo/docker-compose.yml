  # The PostgreSQL Database Service
  # This service uses the official postgres image from Docker Hub.
  postgres-db:
    image: postgres:14.1
    container_name: telemedicine-postgres
    environment:
      # These environment variables are used by the postgres image upon first run
      # to set up the database, user, and password.
      POSTGRES_DB: telemedicine_db
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: Vishal@12#34
    ports:
      # Maps the container's internal port 5432 to the host machine's port 5432.
      # This allows you to connect to the database from your local machine if needed.
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      # This creates a named volume to persist the database data on the host machine.
      # This ensures your data is not lost when you stop or remove the container.

  # The Spring Boot Application Service
  # This service builds and runs our Telemedicine application.

      # is started and healthy before this application container starts.
